# CodeFast

## Introduction

This project is a library of user interface components (UI components) built with **TypeScript**,
**React**, and **TailwindCSS**.
All components in the library are designed based on **Radix UI** standards to ensure performance,
scalability, and ease of customization for real-world projects.

## Objectives

- **Reusability**: Provide versatile UI components that can be used across multiple projects.
- **Flexible Customization**: Utilize **Tailwind Variants** to easily override or extend default styles.
- **High Performance**: Optimized to improve loading speed and minimize unnecessary resources.
- **Clear Codebase**: Modern structure that is easy to read and maintain.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Build components with powerful and extensible features.
- **TypeScript**: Enhance code safety and reduce development errors.
- **TailwindCSS**: Quickly and flexibly describe the interface using utility classes.
- **Radix UI**: Delivers robust functionality for foundational UI components.
- **Zod**: Support data validation and verification.
